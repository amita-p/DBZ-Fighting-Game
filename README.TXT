Changes
-------
There are a few minor changes in Ready from the documentation and book:

(1) The "one window mode" in the editor is not active in Ready 1.0.  Since 
    all the examples use "multiple window mode", this should not be a problem.
    
(2) The book lists all the documentation in the Support\Documentation folder
    as available in PDF or HTML format.  It is only available in PDF format.
    The PDF format is the format used by Adobe Acrobat.  If you do not have
    Acrobat Reader installed on your system, you can get a free copy at
    <http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html>.
    
(3) The Administrator's guide was not available at the time of publication.
    Check our web site under Ready on the Web/Ready Home Page in the 
    Help menu or at <http://www.holtsoft.com/ready> for availability.  It 
    will be a free download of a PDF file at that time.
    
(4) All example programs for "Introduction to Programming in Java" and
    "Data Structures in Java" published by Holt Software are available
    in the directory Examples that is installed in the same directory as
    the Ready executable.

(5) If you have questions about the editor, please consult the documentation
    located in the Support\Documentation folder.  The Support folder is 
    located in the same directory as where you installed Ready.  The 
    Documentation folder contains the installation instructions, a tutorial 
    introduction to Ready, and the Ready user's guide.
    
(6) This version of Ready uses Java 1.4.2_01, unless you are using Windows 95, 
    in which case Ready uses Java 1.3.1_09.

(7) If you are wondering about the chapter and page numbering, together, all
    three make a single book.  If you would like a printed copy of the book, 
    please check our web site.


    We hope you enjoy the use of the Ready to Program software.
